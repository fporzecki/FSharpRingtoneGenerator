# FSharpRingtoneGenerator

A simple F# app with some C# interop for creating a simplistic graphical interface.

The app itself is a sine wave audio file generator, comparable with the old-school Nokia 3310 ringtones.
Musical score notation is the same as in the old Nokia composer.

The app was created as a F# practice project, it's far from being perfect or even good.
